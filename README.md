# Instagram-Giveaway-Selector

### Instagram Giveaway Selector

### Overview

The Instagram Giveaway Selector is a web application designed to select a random winner from a pool of Instagram users who have participated in a giveaway by tagging other users, liking a post, and following the author. The application uses a Python Flask backend to process Instagram data and a simple HTML front-end to display the results.

This project is a slightly revised version of Gaisin's Instacheck, adapted for specific use cases and enhanced with additional features.

### Features

Instagram Integration: Connects to Instagram to check user interactions with giveaway posts.

Giveaway Logic: Identifies users who tagged at least 3 unique users, liked the post, and follow the author.

Winner Selection: Randomly selects a winner from eligible users.

Responsive Front-End: Displays results and error messages in a user-friendly manner with animations.
